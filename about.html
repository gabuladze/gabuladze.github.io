    <p>
        Software engineer with 7+ years solving complex technical problems across the full stack—from blockchain protocol modifications to scalable microservices and user-facing applications. I'm known for quickly mastering unfamiliar technologies and delivering high-impact solutions: I've tripled transaction processing speeds, implemented blockchain hard forks, built smart contracts managing $2M+ TVL, and architected full-stack monitoring systems from scratch. Whether it's optimizing Go-based infrastructure, building React frontends, or diving into protocol-level improvements, I thrive on tackling hard problems that require both deep technical skills and rapid learning. Currently at Chiliz, where I work across the entire technology stack to build robust, scalable systems.
